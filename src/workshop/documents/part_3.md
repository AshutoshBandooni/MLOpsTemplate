# Part 3: Use GitHub for Version Control and Automation

## Goal 
- Setup a centralized version control to keep track of project code and manage different feature development tracks and releases
- Understand how to automate and orchestrate common tasks such as environment setup, training, testing 

## Pre-requisites
- Complete parts 0, 1, and 2
- Familiarity with git

## Tasks
- Setup Github repo and prepare neccessary connections and credentials 
- Discuss about Branch strategy
- Learn about Github Action and Workflow
- Design an automated unit test task on a feature branch such as Feature_Engineering where upon pushing the code, an automated unit test is run to make sure the module performs correctly.

## Success criteria
- Service Principal is created and credentials are in Github
- Understanding of branch strategy with feature branch, integration branch and main branch
- Understanding of what workflows are and how they can be triggered
- Successfully run one workflow from feature branch 

## Reference materials
