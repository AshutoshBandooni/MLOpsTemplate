    # Part 2: Use cloud scale compute and monitor experiment with Azure ML

    ## Goal 
    After successfully restructuring the jupyter notebook and run modules locally, your team wants to leverage Azure cloud to run the experiment at scale.
    They also want to take advantage of experiment tracking and model management capabilities in Azure ML to keep track of experiment.   

    ## Pre-requisites
    - Complete part 0 and 1

    ## Tasks
    - Run individual modules with azure ml using the CLI v2.
    - Create a pipeline that run feature_engineering, training and evaluation together
    - Capture metrics and log model using mlflow 


    ## Success criteria
    - Run the module individually in Azure 
    - Capture metrics and models in ml_training and ml_evaluating modules
    - Run three modules together in a pipeline
