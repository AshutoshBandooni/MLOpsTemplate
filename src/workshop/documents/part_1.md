# Part 1: Structure code for fast iterative development

### Goal 
Your team has been working on a new ML problem. The team has been performing exploratory work on data and algorithm and has come to the state that the solution direction is solidified. Now, it is a time to put a structure into the work so that the team can iterate faster toward building a fully functional solution.   

So far, team members working mostly on Jupyter notebook on their personal compute (Azure CI & PC), as the first step in MLOps, you need to re-engineer the process so that the team can achieve the followings:  

- Modularization: restructure the notebook into python modules
- Parameterization: Adding parameters so that modules can be rerun with different parameters 

### Pre-requisites
- Complete the setup process to setup Azure ML workspace
- Run data setup to create local datasets for unit test as well remote full dataset

### Tasks
- Review the jupyter notebook that represent the work of a data scientist up to this point, make sure you can run the notebook and understand it. 
- Split the notebook into following modules
    - feature engineering
    - model evaluating
    - model training 
- parameterize the module so that
