# MLOps Workshop

## Introduction
<br/> MLOps workshop is a intructor lead workshop that provides step by step guidance on implementation of modern MLOps in Azure platform.
<br/> MLOps workshop presents a scenario of a data science team progressing through increasing levels of maturity in automating ML development and deployment.
<br/> It provides easy-to-follow guidance, templates and reusable software modules so that learners can quickly apply in their own project.
<br/> This workshop aims to bring clarify and simplify the implementation of MLOps in Azure.

## Audience
Customer data scientists, ML engineers, ML platform architects and managers who need practical and hands-on understanding of how to build and run MLOps pipeline in Azure. 

## Goals: 

- Understand key elements of modern MLOps and how it helps improve and accelerate ML practice  

- How to design experiment and deployment environments and MLOps pipelines 

- Get hands-on experience in building continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines with new Azure ML vNext and Github actions 
## Structure
- Part 0: MLOps overview and environment setup
- Part 1: Structure code for fast iterative development
- Part 2: Use cloud scale compute and monitor experiment with Azure ML
- Part 3: Use github for version control and automation
- Part 4: Continuous integration (CI)
- Part 5: Continuous deployment (CD) 
- Part 6: Observability
